## NBA Machine Learning Model

The NBA's Most Valuable Player award goes to player that contributes the most to their team's success, as well as their own personal statistics, over the course of the regular season. 100 voters are selected by the organization and decide on which of the most successful players receiev this award. While the MVP is supposed to go to the best player in the leage, there is often discourse surrounding the voting criteria, and whether or not a player's name or aspects like popularity contribute to the outcome of MVP voting. In our project, we aim to separate the player's performance from their name and use an anonymous player's statistics to predict if they are worthy of the Most Valuable Player award. We create different machine learning models constisting of a nearest neighbor, a support vector machine, and a decision tree model to establish a strong method of classification for the Most Valuable Player award. We pull our data from a reputable source, basketball-reference.com, and look at the most relevant data from 2018 to 2023, excluding the 2021 season due to COVID. In this project, we will analyze the most relevant factors when considering the MVP award winner and create multiple machine learning models capable of this classification task.
